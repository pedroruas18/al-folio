abstract = {Recommender systems (RS) have been successfully explored in a vast number of domains, e.g. movies and tv shows, music, or e-commerce. In these domains we have a large number of datasets freely available for testing and evaluating new recommender algorithms. For example, Movielens and Netflix datasets for movies, Spotify for music, and Amazon for e-commerce, which translates into a large number of algorithms applied to these fields. In scientific fields, such as Health and Chemistry, standard and open access datasets with the information about the preferences of the users are scarce. First, it is important to understand the application domain, i.e. "what the recommended item is". Second, who are the end users: researchers, pharmacists, clinicians or policy makers. Third, the availability of data. Thus, if we wish to develop an algorithm for recommending scientific items, we do not have access to datasets with information about the past preferences of a group of users. Given this limitation, we developed a methodology, called LIBRETTI - LIterature Based RecommEndaTion of scienTific Items, whose goal is the creation of <user, item, rating> datasets, related with scientific fields. These datasets are created based on the major resource of knowledge that Science has: scientific literature. We consider the users as the authors of the publications, the items as the scientific entities (for example chemical compounds or diseases), and the ratings as the number of publications an author wrote about an entity. In this tutorial we will approach state-of-the-art recommender systems in scientific fields, explain what is Named Entity Recognition/Linking (NER/NEL) in research literature, and to demonstrate how to create a dataset for recommending drugs and diseases through research literature related to COVID-19. Our goal is to spread the use of LIBRETTI methodology in order to help in the development of recommender algorithms in scientific fields.

abstract = {This review is aimed at providing a comprehensive outline of the immune response displayed against cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), the more common zoonotic infection caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. Although of polymorphic clinical presentation, classically CL is characterized by leishmaniotic lesions on the face and extremities of the patients, which can be ulcerative, and even after healing can lead to permanent injuries and disfigurement, affecting significantly their psychological, social, and economic well-being. According a report released by the World Health Organization, the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to leishmaniasis are close to 2.4 million, annually there are 1.0-1.5 million new cases of CL, and a numerous population is at risk in the endemic areas. Despite its increasing worldwide incidence, it is one of the so-called neglected tropical diseases. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of the existing knowledge of the host innate and acquired immune response to cutaneous species of Leishmania. The use of animal models and of in vitro studies has improved the understanding of parasite-host interplay and the complexity of immune mechanisms involved. The importance of diagnosis accuracy associated with effective patient management in CL reduction is highlighted. However, the multiple factors involved in CL epizoology associated with the unavailability of vaccines or drugs to prevent infection make difficult to formulate an effective strategy for CL control.},

abstract = {Tracking the most recent advances in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related research is essential, given the disease's novelty and its impact on society. However, with the publication pace speeding up, researchers and clinicians require automatic approaches to keep up with the incoming information regarding this disease. A solution to this problem requires the development of text mining pipelines; the efficiency of which strongly depends on the availability of curated corpora. However, there is a lack of COVID-19-related corpora, even more, if considering other languages besides English. This project's main contribution was the annotation of a multilingual parallel corpus and the generation of a recommendation dataset (EN-PT and EN-ES) regarding relevant entities, their relations, and recommendation, providing this resource to the community to improve the text mining research on COVID-19-related literature. This work was developed during the 7th Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH7).},

abstract = {Leishmaniasis is one of the most neglected diseases in the World, according to the WHO, with new registered 300 000 cases every year. This disease affects mainly individuals from low income countries, where the access to diagnosis and treatment is very difficult. Besides this, the available chemotherapy is losing efficacy due to the emergence of resistant strains. So, there is a need for the development of new antileishmanial compounds and new strategies to refrain the impact of the disease. The proteins belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family are transporters present in a wide variety of cells (from prokaryotes to eukaryotes) involved in the efflux of molecules. In many cases, these transporters become responsible for multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotypes and other resistance events in cells. One of the strategy to overcome this resistance is to use efflux pump inhibitors (EPI). The general goal of the present work is determine the action of efflux pumps in a context where macrophages from a cellular line (P388D1) get infected with more resistant Leishmania promastigotes from several species (Leishmania infantum, Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania shawi and Leishmania guyanensis) and are exposed simultaneously to antileishmanial drugs/experimental compounds and efflux pump inhibitors. In this work, the first step was to differentiate different strains susceptible to Glucantime (GLUC), Miltefosine (MILT), ursolic acid (URS), chalcone-8 (CH8) and quercetine (QC). For the resistant strains obtained, the IC50 of the experimental compounds URS, CH8 and QC were then calculated. At last, in a context of macrophages infected with the different more resistant strains, it was evaluated the effect in their relative infection rate of a treatment consisting in experimental compounds combined with EPI, such as verapamil (VER), sodium orthovanadate (ORT) and Phe-Arg $\beta$-naphthylamide (PA$\beta$N). All the treatments could significantly reduce the relative infection rate of macrophages infected with the susceptible strains of Leishmania infantum, with the exception of the treatment with CH8 and VER in INF CH8 strain. For the several strains of Leishmania amazonensis, all treatments reduced the relative infection rate, with the exception for the treatments containing ORT, which seems to be harmless to this species. On the opposite side are the strains of Leishmania shawi and Leishmania guyanensis, where none of the treatments was able to reduce the relative infection rate of the macrophages. The EPI can effectively decrease the activity of efflux pumps activity and increase the efficacy of antileishmanial drugs, and because of this, its use can be a possible alternative treatment for leishmaniasis.},

Our system comprises two modules: entity linking and extreme multi- label classification. The first module uses the entities recognized in text and then applies a graph-based entity linking model to link them to the DeCS vocabulary. In the end, it applies a semantic similarity- based filter to determine the most relevant entities in each document, which are then fed to the second module. The second module consists of an adapted version of the X-Transformer algorithm, and is responsible for associating each document with the top-20 relevant DeCS codes, which can be viewed as an extreme multi-label classification algorithm. The obtained results (micro F1-scores) were 0.2007, 0.0686, and 0.0314 for sub-tracks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. These represent low values when compared to other participants, mainly because of the lack of time our team had available to train the models.

abstract = {The discovery of new chemical compounds is perceived as a key driver of the chemistry industry and many other economic sectors. The information about the new discoveries are usually disclosed in scientific literature and in particular, in chemical patents, since patents are often the first venues where the new chemical compounds are publicized. Despite the significance of the information provided in chemical patents, extracting the information from patents is costly due to the large volume of existing patents and its drastic expansion rate. The Cheminformat-ics Elsevier Melbourne University (ChEMU) evaluation lab 2020, part of the Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum 2020 (CLEF2020), provides a platform to advance the state-of-the-arts in automatic information extraction systems over chemical patents. In particular, we focus on extracting synthesis process of new chemical compounds from chemical patents. Using the ChEMU corpus of 1500 "snippets" (text segments) sampled from 170 patent documents and annotated by chemical experts, we defined two key information extraction tasks. Task 1 targets at chemical named entity recognition, i.e., the identification of chemical compounds and their specific roles in chemical reactions. Task 2 targets at event extraction, i.e., the identification of reaction steps, relating the chemical compounds involved in a chemical reaction. In this paper, we provide an overview of our ChEMU2020 lab. Herein, we describe the resources created for the two tasks, the evaluation methodology adopted, and participants results. We also provide a brief summary of the methods employed by participants of this lab and the results obtained across 46 runs from 11 teams, finding that several submissions achieve substantially better results than the baseline methods prepared by the organizers .},

abstract = {Background: Named Entity Linking systems are a powerful aid to the manual curation of digital libraries, which is getting increasingly costly and inefficient due to the information overload. Models based on the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm are one of the state-of-the-art approaches, but these have low performance when the disambiguation graphs are sparse. Findings: This work proposes a Named Entity Linking framework designated by Relation Extraction for Entity Linking (REEL) that uses automatically extracted relations to overcome this limitation. Our method builds a disambiguation graph, where the nodes are the ontology candidates for the entities and the edges are added according to the relations established in the text, which the method extracts automatically. The PPR algorithm and the information content of each ontology are then applied to choose the candidate for each entity that maximises the coherence of the disambiguation graph. We evaluated the method on three gold standards: the subset of the CRAFT corpus with ChEBI annotations (CRAFT-ChEBI), the subset of the BC5CDR corpus with disease annotations from the MEDIC vocabulary (BC5CDR-Diseases) and the subset with chemical annotations from the CTD-Chemical vocabulary (BC5CDR-Chemicals). The F1-Score achieved by REEL was 85.8%, 80.9% and 90.3% in these gold standards, respectively, outperforming baseline approaches. Conclusions: We demonstrated that RE tools can improve Named Entity Linking by capturing semantic information expressed in text missing in Knowledge Bases and use it to improve the disambiguation graph of Named Entity Linking models. REEL can be adapted to any text mining pipeline and potentially to any domain, as long as there is an ontology or other knowledge Base available.},

abstract = {Background: Biomedical literature concerns a wide range of concepts, requiring controlled vocabularies to maintain a consistent terminology across different research groups. However, as new concepts are introduced, biomedical literature is prone to ambiguity, specifically in fields that are advancing more rapidly, for example, drug design and development. Entity linking is a text mining task that aims at linking entities mentioned in the literature to concepts in a knowledge base. For example, entity linking can help finding all documents that mention the same concept and improve relation extraction methods. Existing approaches focus on the local similarity of each entity and the global coherence of all entities in a document, but do not take into account the semantics of the domain. Results: We propose a method, PPR-SSM, to link entities found in documents to concepts from domain-specific ontologies. Our method is based on Personalized PageRank (PPR), using the relations of the ontology to generate a graph of candidate concepts for the mentioned entities. We demonstrate how the knowledge encoded in a domain-specific ontology can be used to calculate the coherence of a set of candidate concepts, improving the accuracy of entity linking. Furthermore, we explore weighting the edges between candidate concepts using semantic similarity measures (SSM). We show how PPR-SSM can be used to effectively link named entities to biomedical ontologies, namely chemical compounds, phenotypes, and gene-product localization and processes. Conclusions: We demonstrated that PPR-SSM outperforms state-of-the-art entity linking methods in four distinct gold standards, by taking advantage of the semantic information contained in ontologies. Moreover, PPR-SSM is a graph-based method that does not require training data. Our method improved the entity linking accuracy of chemical compounds by 0.1385 when compared to a method that does not use SSMs.},

This work aims to build a new semantic-based pipeline for recommending biomedical entities to scientific researchers. To this end, we developed a pipeline that creates an implicit feedback matrix based on Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a corpus of documents, using multidisciplinary ontologies for recognizing and linking the entities. Our hypothesis is that by using ontologies from different fields in the NER phase, we can improve the results for state-of-the-art collaborative-filtering recommender systems applied to the dataset created. The tests performed using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) dataset show that when using four ontologies, the results for precision@k, for example, reach the 80%, whereas when using only one ontology, the results for precision@k drops to 20%, for the same users. Furthermore, the use of multi-fields entities may help in the discovery of new items, even if the researchers do not have items from that field in their set of preferences.},

However, the rate of publication of new articles have been steadily rising, exceeding the human capacity to effectively manage and assess this large amount of unstructured text: researchers spend more time and effort to retrieve scientific information and the task of biocurators also gets more difficult, due to the unstructured nature of the text that hinders the application of automatic tools. Text Mining methods can help to manage this situation, more concretely by automatically extracting information from the text in scientific literature. Entity Linking, the task of automatically mapping entities recognized in text to a knowledge base concept, is an essential step in Text Mining workflows. But, comparing to other domains like social media text, the availability of EL tools capable of performing well in biomedical text is still scarce. This dissertation proposes a module that performs Entity Linking in documents annotated with entities from two biomedical ontologies: Gene Ontology (GO) and Uber-Anatomy Ontology (Uberon). The system applies the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm and semantic similarity measures to choose the best candidate for each entity in text. The performance of the system was evaluated on CRAFT corpus (gold standard), achieving an accuracy of 0.8244 in GO Biological Process entities, 0.7258 in GO Cellular Component entities and 0.7918 in Uberon entities. Additionally, the system was evaluated on the MSNBC gold standard containing DBpedia entities and achieved an accuracy of 0.8814, which compares well with other state-of-the-art systems. The code behind the module can be accessed in the LaSIGE Biomedical Text Mining Team GitHub page: https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/PPRSSM. The results of the present work prove that it is possible to successfully apply semantic similarity measures in PPR-based systems and explore biomedical ontologies for the improvement of the EL task.},
