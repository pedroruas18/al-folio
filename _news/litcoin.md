I'm pleased to announce that the Lasige-Unicage team achieved the [7th place](https://ncats.nih.gov/funding/challenges/litcoin/winners) in the [LitCoin Challenge](https://www.nasa.gov/litcoin-challenge) and was awarded a cash prize of 5.000 USD!

The LitCoin Challenge was part of the NASA Tournament Lab and was hosted by NCBI (The National Center for Biotechnology Information), NCATS (The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences) and NIH (National Institutes of Health).

There were two phases with different goals:

<ul>
    <li>Phase 1: Identification of biomedical entities in abstracts of scientific texts</li>
    <li>Phase 2: Identification of the relations between the biomedical entities and prediction of novelty</li>
</ul>

I was specifically responsible for the approach developed to tackle the first phase, which consisted of a Named Entity Recognition model able to identify entities in abstracts of the following types:
<ul>
<li>DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature </li>
<li>ChemicalEntity </li>
<li>OrganismTaxon </li>
<li>GeneOrGeneProduct </li>
<li>SequenceVariant </li>
<li>CellLine </li>
</ul>
