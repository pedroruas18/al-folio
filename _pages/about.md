Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student in the PhD Programme in Informatics at the [Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en).

My research interests include:

- Natural Language Processing
- Machine learning
- Bioinformatics
- Text Mining

I work mostly with biomedical text, such as scientific articles, clinical records, patents.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently collaborating with the [LasigeBioTM research group](https://github.com/lasigeBioTM)
